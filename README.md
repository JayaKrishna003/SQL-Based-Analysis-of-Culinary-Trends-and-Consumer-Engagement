# 🍽️ Restaurant Ratings & Consumer Preferences Analysis

This repository contains my solo project focused on **analyzing restaurant ratings and consumer preferences** using SQL. The project is designed to uncover trends, preferences, and behaviors related to restaurant performance and consumer demographics.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Understanding consumer behavior and restaurant performance is vital for business decisions in the food and hospitality industry. Using SQL-based queries on a normalized database of restaurants, cuisines, ratings, and consumers, this project identifies:

- Top-rated restaurants by cuisine  
- Student and occupation-based preferences  
- Mexican restaurant trends  
- City-based rating comparisons  
- Consumer engagement and behavior patterns  

This helps businesses and analysts make **data-driven decisions** about marketing, operations, and customer targeting.
